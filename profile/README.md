🥼 **About Future Systems Lab**
Future Systems Lab advances applied informatics and blockchain infrastructure for healthcare. Originating from wellness product development and retail space design, it now applies those same principles of transparency, traceability, and trust through blockchain-enabled digital health systems. The lab connects data integrity, decentralized identity, consent, and analytics—building scalable, compliant, and human-centered solutions for modern healthcare.

📌 **Pinned Case Studies**  
Future Systems Lab demonstrates applied expertise across decentralized health innovation, informatics, product design, and retail experience design.

- **[CBD Continuum Retail](https://github.com/Future-Systems-Lab/CBD-Continuum-Retail)** — first CBD wellness retail in Apex, NC. Showcased holistic retail design through store buildout, branding, merchandising, packaging, COA verification, and customer education. The retail model served as a real-world foundation for the Lab’s later blockchain applications in data transparency and provenance.
