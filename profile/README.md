🥼 **About Future Systems Lab**
Future Systems Lab advances applied informatics and blockchain infrastructure for healthcare. Originating from wellness product development and retail space design, it now applies those same principles of transparency, traceability, and trust through blockchain-enabled digital health systems. The lab connects data integrity, decentralized identity, consent, and analytics—building scalable, compliant, and human-centered solutions for modern healthcare.

### 🧩 HypnoNeuro Modular Framework  
Progressive therapeutic modules designed for **data-informed personalization**, **tokenized engagement**, and **interoperable governance**. Each layer represents a testable methodology for evidence-based digital-health delivery.

| Level | Module | Focus | Status |
|:------:|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| **L1** | Hypnosis Room | Guided subconscious reprogramming and behavioral analytics | *in progress* |
| **L2** | Orthomolecular Room | Nutritional and biochemical optimization through personalized informatics | *in progress* |
| **L3** | Narrative Room | Emotional reintegration through metaphor (“EJ’s Path” & “Isiah: The King”) demonstrating AI-driven storytelling as therapy | ✅ complete |

**Core Principle:**  
> Delivers emotional safety through metaphor instead of direct re-exposure.
