## 🧭 Mission, Vision & Values

### **Mission**
Future Systems Lab advances human-centered digital health by integrating applied informatics, decentralized identity, and blockchain-based consent systems to strengthen transparency, trust, and safety in modern care.

### **Vision**
To create a healthcare ecosystem where every individual controls their data, every system is interoperable, and every digital interaction is secured, verifiable, and emotionally safe—powered by intelligent, dignified, and equitable technology.

### **Core Values**
- **Integrity:** Data accuracy, reproducibility, and verifiable transparency.  
- **Safety:** Emotional safety through metaphor instead of direct re-exposure.  
- **Interoperability:** Open standards, FHIR alignment, and decentralized consent.  
- **Innovation:** Applied research across blockchain, AI, sensory design, and informatics.  
- **Human-Centered Design:** Systems built for clarity, autonomy, and empowerment.

## Verification & Reproducibility

Each architecture PNG has a matching Mermaid source file to ensure reproducibility.

To verify a diagram:
1. Open the matching `.mmd` file from `architecture/mermaid/`
2. Paste its contents into Mermaid Live Editor
3. Confirm it renders identically to the PNG

This supports academic reproducibility, system governance alignment, and documentation traceability across all layers (Security, Wearables, Full System, Blockchain, AI/Data).
