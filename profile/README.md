# 🧱 Architecture Layers (System Index)

The Future Systems Lab architecture is documented as a **layered, modular system** spanning blockchain, security, data, wearables, and AI analytics.

To protect **pre-commercial IP, security design, and governance logic**, detailed diagrams and source files are maintained in **private, invite-only repositories**.

---

## 📐 Public Architecture Overview (High-Level)

The following layers represent the system structure at a **conceptual and educational level**.  
Detailed diagrams, Mermaid source files, and implementation notes are available **upon request**.

### 1. Blockchain Layer
**Scope:**
- Wallet-based identity (EVM-compatible)
- On-chain consent registry
- Tokenized audit events
- Non-PHI transaction logging

**Status:**  
Private diagrams and contracts (invite-only)

---

### 2. Security & Privacy Layer
**Scope:**
- Wallet-based pseudonymization
- Consent gating
- On-chain revocation events
- Off-chain encrypted storage boundaries

**Frameworks Referenced:**
- HIPAA-informed (no PHI on-chain)
- GDPR-aligned (data minimization, revocation)
- ALCOA principles (audit integrity)

**Status:**  
Private security architecture (invite-only)

---

### 3. Wearables & Sensors Layer (NeuroBalance Watch)
**Scope:**
- Consent-aware wearable ingestion
- Wellness-grade sensor modeling
- Educational biomarker visualization
- Explicit user permission controls

**Status:**  
Private R&D diagrams and prototypes (invite-only)

---

### 4. Full Ecosystem Architecture
**Scope:**
- End-to-end system flow
- Identity → Consent → Analytics → Governance
- Modular separation of clinical, educational, and research layers

**Status:**  
Private system diagrams (invite-only)

---

### 5. Orthomolecular AI Architecture
**Scope:**
- Educational neurotransmitter modeling
- Pattern-based (non-diagnostic) insights
- AI-assisted visualization
- Governance-aware analytics design

**Status:**  
Private AI architecture and notebooks (invite-only)

---

## 🧬 Data Layer (Conceptual)

**Design Principles:**
- No PHI on-chain
- Pseudonymous identifiers
- Separation of identity, consent, and analytics
- Auditability without clinical exposure

**Artifacts:**
- ERD diagrams
- Consent-linked session models
- Analytics-ready schemas

**Status:**  
Private ERDs and schemas (invite-only)

---

## 🔒 Security, Privacy & Compliance Framework

### HIPAA-Informed
- No protected health information stored on-chain  
- Encrypted off-chain storage only  
- Wallet-based pseudonymous identity  

### GDPR-Aligned
- Data minimization  
- Explicit consent toggles  
- On-chain revocation events  

### ALCOA Principles
- **Attributable**  
- **Legible**  
- **Contemporaneous**  
- **Original**  
- **Accurate**

## ⚠️ Access Notice

> The architecture diagrams, Mermaid source files, and supporting documentation referenced in this section are maintained in **private, invite-only repositories**.
>
> Public access is intentionally restricted to protect:
> - Pre-commercial intellectual property  
> - Security and threat-model design  
> - Governance and compliance logic  
>
> **Access is available to recruiters, academic reviewers, and partners upon request.**

## 🔁 Verification & Reproducibility (Upon Access)

For authorized reviewers:

1. Each architecture PNG has a corresponding Mermaid (`.mmd`) source file  
2. Mermaid files can be rendered independently to verify fidelity  
3. Diagrams are traceable across layers (Security, Wearables, Blockchain, AI/Data)

This supports **academic reproducibility**, **governance alignment**, and **documentation integrity**.
