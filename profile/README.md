## ⌚ NeuroBalance Watch
**Category:** Wearable Digital Health R&D  
**Focus:** On-Chain Consent • Biosensing Precursors • Orthomolecular Insight Engine

**Summary:**  
A next-generation educational wearable prototype integrating on-chain consent, amino-acid precursor biosensing (R&D), and a modular React Native watch interface.  
NeuroBalance models precursor activity for dopamine, serotonin, GABA, endorphins, and the endocannabinoid system (ECS), generating human-readable orthomolecular insights without clinical claims.

**What It Demonstrates:**  
- Smart contract architecture (Sepolia)  
- Consent governance for wearables  
- Multi-analyte electrochemical sensor R&D  
- Orthomolecular neuromodulator modeling  
- Full demo (screenshots + video)  
- A polished product flow from contract → data → UX  

**Repository:**

## 🧩 HypnoNeuro Modular Framework
**Category:** Decentralized Therapeutic Design  
**Focus:** Tokenized Engagement • AI Personalization • Story-Based Reintegration

### Overview
A modular framework for applied research in:
- AI-assisted emotional processing  
- data-integrated wellness analytics  
- tokenized behavioral reinforcement (NFT credentialing)

Each module connects to **HypnoNeuro** for participation rewards and verifiable credentials, **and to EncryptHealth for medication-change verification**.

### What’s Live Now
- **L2 Orthomolecular Dashboard MVP**  
  Wallet connect → medication confirmation → mood sliders → **Analyze** → educational naturopathic insight.  
  - Live: https://orthomolecular-dashboard-4xyc07ulv-megs-projects-95a11e5b.vercel.app  
  - Repo: https://github.com/Future-Systems-Lab/Orthomolecular-Dashboard  
  - Data model: JSON (amino-acid precursors → neurotransmitter synthesis potential)  
  - Visualization: Recharts bar chart (Serotonin, Dopamine, GABA, Endorphins, Endocannabinoid)  
  - Tech: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Recharts, Wagmi, Viem, React Query  
  - Health check: `/api/health`  
  - Disclaimer: **Rendered directly under the chart** — “Educational prototype only. Not medical advice. Do not change medications without consulting a qualified professional.”

### Roadmap (Phase 2)
- Cofactors (B6, Mg), lifestyle and nutrient-density inputs  
- Gut–brain axis and detox support modeling  
- EncryptHealth integration for medication changes  
- FHIR/HL7 interoperability  
- Adaptive AI recommendations
