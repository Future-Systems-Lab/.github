## ⌚ NeuroBalance Watch  

**Category:** Wearable Digital Health R&D  
**Focus:** On-Chain Consent • Biosensing • Orthomolecular Insight Engine  

### Summary  

NeuroBalance is a next-generation wearable prototype that models biochemical precursors, captures user-controlled wellness signals, and anchors consent on-chain for transparent data governance.

### What It Demonstrates  

- Smart contract architecture (Sepolia)  
- User-controlled on-chain consent toggles  
- Multi-analyte electrochemical sensor R&D:  
  - Amino-acid precursor detection  
  - pH microfluidics  
  - GSR, skin-temperature, HRV pathway  
- Orthomolecular neuromodulator modeling  
- React Native watch UI prototype  
- Full concept flow: **contract → sensor → insight → UX**

### Ecosystem Alignment  

Built on a user-controlled, on-chain consent model consistent with Future Systems Lab’s broader digital-health architecture.
