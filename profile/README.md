# 🔒 Privacy, Security & Compliance Framework

Future Systems Lab applies a unified privacy and security design across all prototypes to demonstrate how modern digital-health systems maintain transparency, data integrity, and user protection while remaining non-clinical and educational in nature.

### **HIPAA-Informed Design (No PHI On-Chain)**
- Zero identifiable health information is ever written to the blockchain  
- All sensitive data stored off-chain with encryption and role-based access  
- Access logs retained for audit modeling  
- User identity abstracted through wallet/DID pseudonymization

### **GDPR-Aligned Data Handling**
- Pseudonymization of all user identifiers  
- Data minimization: only hashes and references stored on-chain  
- Consent revocation represented through on-chain events  
- Erasure handled entirely off-chain with clean deletion pathways

### **SaMD Awareness (Educational Modeling)**
- Transparent, traceable session logic  
- Clearly defined data flows and algorithm boundaries  
- Demonstrates how wellness-oriented prototypes could interface with regulated frameworks  
- Maintains non-diagnostic, non-clinical positioning

### **ALCOA Data Integrity Principles**
- **Attributable:** User actions tied to wallet signatures  
- **Legible:** Structured event definitions for all interactions  
- **Contemporaneous:** All blockchain and off-chain events timestamped  
- **Original:** On-chain logs provide immutable originals  
- **Accurate:** Hash-linked verification for session, consent, and device data

### **EIP-712 Consent Governance**
- Typed structured consent signatures  
- On-chain event registry for consent + revocation  
- DID/VC-compatible identity modeling  
- Serves as the compliance backbone across the ecosystem (HypnoNeuro, EncryptHealth, InstaPsych, Wearables)
